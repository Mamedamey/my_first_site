<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src= "assets/images/grad pic.jpeg" width="320" length= "15px" alt="Mame"/>

<p><b>Hey guys! My name is Mame' Florence Damey. I'm 23 years old and live in Atlanta GA. I'm a recent graduate from Georgia State University with a degree in Communications. I've always had an interest to fashion  and web design since I was kid, but never seemed to have the confidence to pursue it.  After graduating from college, I struggled with finding a full time job in my field which is an unfortunate reality for most grads. After spending hours finding boring templates to create my SWAAN website I decided that I wanted to challenge myself by creating my website myself using HTML and CSS and I must say I'm so happy with my decision!. After searching for several for web bootcamps online, I stumbled across Tech Talent South and realized it was the best option for me. Learning how to code did not only introduce me to a new world of tech, it also gave me the confidence to interact with other female web developers as well as social entrepreneurs.  Prior to starting the classes I had little to no experience with programming other than basic online tutorials for CSS.  Who would have thought that over he course of 8 short weeks  I would learn HTML CSS and Ruby. Is it challenging? yea, Is it worth it? absolutely! With TTS I was able to gain new career skills as well as join several networks of other amazing women in tech. With the completion of the TTS Immersion Program, I plan to continue building my SWAAN website with the skills I learned during the courses as well as attend several meetups to share SWAAN with other dynamic women to empower each other. For my career, my goal is to become a web developer in the fashion industry bridging the gap between tech and high fashion.<b/>
